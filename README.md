# sodium-frp-react-demo
> Example of how to use the [sodium-react-frp](https://github.com/Ziriax/sodium-frp-react) package

## Usage
```bash
npm i
npm start
```

## Remarks

On Windows, don't use the Visual Studio Developer's command prompt to build this project, since that will add the globally installed version of Typescript to your path. Just start a simple CMD.exe instead, so that the correct version of the Typescript compiler is used.
